# Setting up your machine to run the giffgaff App

## Required installations:
### 1. Download & Install:
You may download some of this through Self-Service, on your laptop.
1. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/ "Chrome") (contains useful developer tools)
2. [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download "Visual Studio Download")
3. [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html "iTerm2")
4. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/ "Docker")
5. Emulators, if you use the app:
6. Get the **Engineering: Command Line Apps** from **Self-service** on your laptop. A script will be downloaded on your Desktop. Run the script you've just downloaded
Example:
```sh
> sh ~/Desktop/engineeringApps.sh
```


### 2. Open the terminal & install
Some of these might be already installed. However, considering you don't, please install:

#### > Brew
Follow the commands [here](https://brew.sh).

#### > [Node.js](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html "Node")
```sh
> brew install node
> brew install nvm
> nvm install 10.15.1
> nvm use 10.15.1
```
It is important to use a specific version as you might have some code problems later on otherwise.

#### > Git:
Do install git first.
```sh
> brew install git
```

If you don't have a [github.com](http://github.com/) account, you should create one first. Then, ask the IT to give you access to giffgaff's repositories.

To link git to your account:
  1. Follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to generate SSH keys (you need them to pair to your account).
  2. Then you have to add the SSH keys to your account. [This guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) will help you.
  3. Then do authorise the SSH keys to be used with the Organization files. The helping guide is [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/authorizing-an-ssh-key-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

TIP: _In case these steps are now working or you get a SAML error, you might not be allocated to an engineering team just yet. Please speak with the IT department._

#### > [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi "Maven")
```sh
> brew install mvnvm
```

### 3. Configuration steps:

I have used *zsh* to do the next configurations but if you use Bash, change the code in .bashrc file instead of .zshrc.

Once you downloaded the programms to install, follow these guides:

#### 3.1 [Prerequisites](https://github.com/giffgaff/giffgaff-re-app/blob/master/docs/system-design/prerequisites.md) guide:

- Install Watchman: *brew install watchman*
- Install Carthage: *brew install carthage*
- Install React Native debugger: *brew cask install react-native-debugger*
- Install Apium: *npm install -g appium*
- Follow the Android Studio installation steps
- Setup Git Repositories

#### 3.2 [Configuration](https://github.com/giffgaff/development-guidelines/tree/master/config) guide:

- To install Java - you need to create the file .zshrc first. Input these commands:
```sh 
> cd
> nano ~/.zshrc
> Copy paste: export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`
> Press Control + X then Y then Enter to save the file
```

- To install Truststore (certificates)
	- Step 1: Download the certificates (3 of them, ask the your team)
	- Step 2: Open a terminal
	- Step 3: Run these commands
	```sh
	> cd $(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)/jre/lib/security
	> sudo keytool -keystore cacerts -importcert -alias giffgaff-root -file ~/downloads/giffgaff-Root-CA.cer -storepass changeit
	> sudo keytool -keystore cacerts -importcert -alias giffgaff-staging -file ~/downloads/giffgaffstagingca.cer -storepass changeit
	> sudo keytool -keystore cacerts -importcert -alias giffgaff-live -file ~/downloads/giffgaffliveca.cer -storepass changeit
	```

- Download the JCE 8 - you need to create an account
	- Once the folder is downloaded, go to your JAVA_HOME folder, into the /jre/lib/security:
	```sh
	> cd $JAVA_HOME
	> cd jre/lib/security
	```
	- Then copy the jar files you downloaded into this folder

- Configure Maven
	- Create a m2 folder in ~/.m2: 
	```sh
	> mkdir ~/.m2/
	> touch settings.xml
	```
	- Copy the settings.xml content into your file and make sure you add the correct password from the One Password vault (ask your team about that)

- Considering you have Docker already installed (and updated), login to Nexus:
```sh
> docker login nexus.giffgaff.co.uk
> Username: giffgaffread
> Password: insert_password_from_vault
```

- Git: follow all the steps in the guide:
	- Create and add the GPG keys to your Git Hub account
	- Copy the Key ID (from GitHub)
	- Then add the key to your config:
	```sh
	> git config --global user.signingkey <gpg-key-id>
	> git config --global commit.gpgsign true
	```


#### 3.3 Setup your IDEs to run React
- Install Expo CLI first: npm install -g expo-cli
- [Android guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html#android-development-environment)
	- Install JDK
	- Follow the steps in the guide
	- Make sure you install - SDK tools, Android Emulator, SDK Platform-tools and Intel Emulator Accelerator
	- Also, you have Android 9 installed 
	- After all is installed, create an AVD (Emulator): Configure -> AVD manager
	- Create Virtual Device
		- AVD Name: giffgaff pixel xl
		- Android 9.0 x86
		- Type of phone: Pixel XL
- [xCode (iOS) guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html#xcode)

#### 3.4 Setup AWS
- Install AWS: 
```sh
> brew install awscli
```
- Install AWS Credentials using this [guide](https://docs.staging.gaff.systems/tooling/gimme-creds/)
- Install gimmeprd using this [guide](https://github.com/giffgaff/giffgaff-re-app/blob/master/docs/dev/android/Readme.md)
- To test if it works use **gimmeprd**
	- While you are in e2eTest (re-app folder):
	```sh
	> aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin https://604083106117.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
	```

### Re-app folder installation:
1. Copy the re-app and graphql server folders (if you didnâ€™t in Setup Git Repositories)
```sh
> git clone git@github.com:giffgaff/giffgaff-re-app.git
```

2. Copy the stubs folders:
```sh
> git clone git@github.com:giffgaff/smart-stubbing-svc.git (to clone this)
> git clone git@github.com:giffgaff/smart-stub-data-loader.git (to clone this)
```

3. Copy the ui-packages folder: 
```sh
> git clone git@github.com:giffgaff/ui-packages.git
```

## Erors & Debugging
1. _Some problems were encountered while processing the POMs_
**Possible solution**: try logging in the Docker again. Also, run the certificates commands again 

2. _TypeError: Cannot read property 'properties' of undefined_
**Possible solution**: 
	- Sometimes you need to delete all the stub folders, copy them again and re-run **npm i** while in them
	- While in graphql-server:
	```sh
	> nvm use 10.15.1
	> npm run build
	> npm start
	```

3. Sometimes you get an error saying that the port is already in use. 
**Possible solution**: You can kill that process, re-run Docker, login again and run Stub servers again. A [guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43026358/spring-boot-application-in-eclipse-the-tomcat-connector-configured-to-listen-on) on how to kill those processes
